    <h2>About Our Team</h2>
    <p>
      In 2017, Weave was co-founded and designed by Jie Jane Chen (Harvard MD
      Class of 2020) and Jonathan Kusner (Harvard MD Class of 2021). The website
      was built by Razzi Abuissa (software engineer). Jane, Jon, and Razzi are
      actively developing Weave to expand its offerings to students, residents,
      and faculty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Jennifer Potter (Advisory Dean for the William Bosworth Castle
      Society) and Dr. Fidencio Salda√±a (Dean for Students) are advisors for
      this mentorship initiative, which is endorsed by the Office of Student
      Affairs at Harvard Medical School.
    </p>

    <h2>How Was Weave Developed?</h2>
    <p>
      A student-driven initiative since its conception, Weave incorporates both
      student and faculty perspectives and was created to facilitate invested
      mentoring relationships and to foster diversity and inclusion at Harvard
      Medical School. In working towards these goals, Weave allows students to
      search for mentors in dimensions that are not strictly academic or
      scholastic. Does a faculty member like to cook, are they from the west
      coast, were they also a first generation student, or do they share the
      same faith as you? In addition to empowering students and faculty to
      connect in this way, Weave allows faculty to clearly communicate their
      capacity for mentorship at a given point in time; faculty may indicate
      their preferred meeting cadence, method of contact, and any additional
      opportunities offered so that students can enter with realistic
      expectations for each relationship.
    </p>

    <h2>Does Weave Stand For Something?</h2>
    <p>
      We named our mentorship platform &apos;Weave&apos; to symbolize the woven
      tightness of a tapestry, where each thread is important to contributing to
      the beautiful image when they all come together. Similarly, community is
      enriched through the diversity of identities and experiences of
      individuals. We aspire to illuminate, celebrate, and nourish both personal
      and professional identities and interests through this platform.
