    <h2>About Our Team</h2>
    <p>Weave was co-founded by Jie Jane Chen and Jonathan Kusner in 2017 during their first year of medical school at Harvard Medical School and built by Razzi Abuissa. Jane, Jon, and Razzi are actively developing Weave to expand its offerings to students, residents, and faculty. Dr. Jennifer Potter (Advisory Dean for the William Bosworth Castle Society) and Dr. Fidencio Salda√±a (Dean for Students) are advisors for this mentorship initiative.</p>

    <h2>How Was Weave Developed?</h2>
    <p>Weave was created with input from both students and faculty, all seeking more invested mentoring relationships at Harvard Medical School. In working towards this goal, Weave allows students to search for mentors in dimensions that are not strictly academic or scholastic. Does a faculty member like to cook, play guitar, were they also a first generation student, or do they share the same faith as you? In addition to allowing students and faculty to connect in this way, Weave allows faculty to clearly communicate their capacity for mentorship at a given point in time; faculty may indicate their preferred meeting cadence, method of contact, and any additional opportunities offered so that students can enter with realistic expectations for each relationship.

    <h2>Does Weave Stand For Something?</h2>
    <p>We named our mentorship platform {"Weave"} to symbolize the woven tightness of a tapestry, where each thread is important to contributing to the beautiful image when they all come together. Similarly, community is enriched through the diversity of identities and experiences of individuals. We aspire to illuminate, celebrate, and nourish both personal and professional identities and interests through this platform.</p>
